## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes
Note: Wireframes were created for a marketplace feature and discussed in class. The group used the wireframes to fully consider the requirements of creating a P2P marketplace and decided that we would make better use of our time if our feature was set up more like a B2C marketplace instead. Rather than the individual listings shown here, wer are pursuing something more like a directory than a chonological listing of products. While these wireframes will not be used in thefinal project, they contributed to a significant narrowing of focus for the project.
