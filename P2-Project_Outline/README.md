##Overview

My project will be a catalog of drag/burlesque/sideshow acts that will allow users to maintain a current portfolio of any numbers available for show bookings. Show producers will have the ability to search within several categories to find the performers that best fit their events. 
Users will be able to create an account, log in, and create and edit act details such as performance style, musical genre, visual themes, subject matter, and photo/video links. They will also have a personal page with booking information, awards and titles, and an artist's statement.

This project was motivated by the needs of local show producers, who often find their casting options limited to their own social network. A searchable database of acts could foster more diverse lineups, create opportunities for newer performers, and offer established performers a way to display their range.

## Features

User login: users will be able to create a profile and log in, allowing them to add and update stage-ready acts as they are developed.

Create and edit acts: users will be able to create new acts in the system by entering a mixture of required (title, theme, music, performance style) and optional fields(specialized skills, technical requirements, descriptive categories).
View by performer: users will be able to see a list of a performer's available repertoire and click through for details on individual acts.

View by Category: users will be able to see a list of all performances available within a given category and click through for details on individual acts.

Search by Keyword: users will be able to search by keyword and see a list of all items meeting this criteria, which may be helpful for theme shows revolving around specific musical artists or pop culture references.

## Technologies

Java * Spring Boot * MySQL * Hibernate * Thymeleaf Templates

## To Learn

It is possible that different technology may be more appropriate for what I want to build, and I will need to do further research on what makes the most sense for my project. I will need to learn more about authentication and logn functionality.
